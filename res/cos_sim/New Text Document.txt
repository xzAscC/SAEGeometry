1. cs with wiki-math
2. pythia-70 un/embedded matrix is different or not
3. explain the cos sim with unembedded matrix; close to 
4. example-based to early layer; projection for deep layer
4. decompose the vector by SAE
6. deep layer is hard to explain(similar frequency patterns)
7. specific concepts in middle layer
8. avg cos sim with inter and inner group, plot them in one figure

Why SAE is good, what is challenge
